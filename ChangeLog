Initial public release
* Command-line tool with several primary modes
* Regression GAIN calculation, including combining SNPs and numeric
attributes in an integrative analysis
* Single nucleotide polymorphism rank (SNPrank)
* Evaporative Cooling (EC) machine learning feature selection
* PLINK data formats, filtering, and several PLINK command-line
options supported

2012-09-10, v1.1
* Fix bug in Benjamini Hochberg FDR pruning threshold and R script
output
* --component-matrices flag for writing component matrices for integrative
analyses (GWAS + additional domains of biological data)
* includes SNPxSNP (.snp.regain), NumericxNumeric (.num.regain), integrative
(.int.regain), and entire block matrix (.block.regain)
* Allow numeric-only analyses without requiring a GWAS data file as input
