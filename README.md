Encore
========

#### A computational tool for integrative analysis of GWAS and other biological data ####

### Description ###
Encore is a free, open-source command-line tool for analysis of GWAS (SNP) and
other types of biological data.  Several modes are available for various types
of analysis, including:

 * Regression of SNPs and quantitative data in epistasis interaction networks
 (Regression [GAIN](http://insilico.utulsa.edu/gain)/reGAIN)
 * Eigenvector centrality ranking of top SNPs/quantitative attributes
 ([SNPrank](http://insilico.utulsa.edu/snprank))
 * Machine learning feature selection algorithms useful for filtering initially
   large data sets to the top few thousand attributes for subsequent analysis
 ([Evaporative Cooling](http://insilico.utulsa.edu/evaporative-cooling)/EC)
 * Data formats and encoding of SNP and quantitative data types
 (PLINK)
 * Several additional options ported from the PLINK library

Many libraries are used to provide various functionality.  The most
prominent is PLINK, a ubiquitous third-party GWAS analysis tool.  We have
modified the latest stable source release of PLINK into a library used to handle
GWAS formats, filter data, and provide statistical/association tests.  See our
PLINK project page for more details.

Evaporative Cooling (EC) is another key library, and provides feature selection
of SNPs and quantitative data, using ReliefF and Random Forest/Jungle for
interactions and main effects, respectively.  EC is also available as a
standalone [tool](http://insilico.utulsa.edu/evaporative-cooling).

Encore is being developed by the McKinney Lab In Silico Research Group at the
Tandy School of Computer Science of the
[University of Tulsa](http://www.utulsa.edu).  Our research is sponsored by the
NIH and William K. Warren foundation.  For more details, visit our research
[website](http://insilico.utulsa.edu).

Encore.

### Dependencies ###
* EC library, available as a source release on the EC project page, and its
dependencies:

  * [Random Jungle](http://github.com/insilico/randomjungle)

  * gfortran, sometimes installed alongside compiler tools

  * GNU Scientific library (libgsl)

  * libxml2

* [Boost](http://www.boost.org) system, filesystem, and program-options libraries 
 
* The libz/zlib compression library is required, but this is installed by default
on most Unix systems.  In MinGW libz is installed via mingw-get.

* [Armadillo](http://arma.sourceforge.net), LAPACK and BLAS for the optimized
linear algebra code

* OpenMP is required to take advantage of the parallelized regression GAIN 
analysis code.  This is another library typically installed alongside the 
compiler toolchain.

### Compilation Environment and Instructions ###
To compile this code, a GNU toolchain and suitable environment are required.
GNU g++ has been used to successfully compile the code.

We have successfully built and run Encore on:

 * Linux (64-bit Ubuntu) (gcc-4.6)
 * Mac (10.6 - 10.7) (gcc-4.2.1)
 * Windows 7 (32-bit) using the [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org) compiler system
  (gcc-4.6)

To build Encore, first run the bootstrap script

    ./bootstrap.sh

This calls autoreconf and generates the configure script.  From this point, a 
standard

    ./configure && make && sudo make install

will generate the `Makefile`, compile and link the code, and copy the objects to
the installation directory (default of `/usr/local`).  As is convention, headers
are installed in `$PREFIX/include`, binary in `$PREFIX/bin`, and libraries in
`$PREFIX/lib`.

The resulting binary encore/encore.exe will run as a command-line tool.

All commands will include an input file (`-i/--input-file`), and, optionally, 
an output file prefix (`-o/--output-prefix`).  Each command must include a 
single mode, denoted in the help screen with `*mode*`.

To perform a regression GAIN (reGAIN) analysis,

    ./encore -i snpdata.ped --regain -o result

This will use genotype/phenotype information from `snpdata.ped`, a PLINK
plaintext GWAS file, in the regression.  All of the output files produced will
be prepended with 'result'.

Once a `.regain` file is produced, this can be used as input for eigenvector 
centrality ranking with SNPrank.

    ./encore -i result.regain --snprank -o rankings


This produces a file called `rankings.snprank`, in which the SNPs are ranked 
in descending order, along with their associated SNPrank and information gain
(IG) scores.

To invoke EC to filter the original SNP data,

    ./encore -i snpdata.ped --ec -o filtered

Additional EC-based options can be specified, such as `--ec-algorithm` and
`--ec-snp-metric` to select the EC algorithm and SNP metric, respectively.
